Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 1.1.1 release candidate

Hi all!

The Ruboto 1.1.1 release candidate is now available.

This release introduces a significant speedup of all UI actions by only
overriding those Java methods actually implemented in Ruby code.  There
are also some bug fixes and improvements to the SSL and big-app features.

As always we need your help and feedback to ensure the quality of the release.  Please install the release candidate using

    [sudo] gem install ruboto --pre

and test your apps after updating with

    ruboto update app

If you have an app released for public consumption, please let us know.  Our developer program seeks to help developers getting started using Ruboto, and ensure good quality across Ruboto releases.  Currently we are supporting the apps listed here:
